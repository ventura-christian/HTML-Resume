        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a college student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in
          Information Technology at Arizona State University, with a
          concentration in full-stack web development. I'm building a strong
          foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while expanding into modern
          developer stacks that connect front-end, back-end, and AI-driven
          technologies. My goal is to gain hands-on experience through a tech
          internship-ideally one that involves working with websites,
          applications, or codebases in a meaningful, production-level
          environment. I'm eager to contribute, learn, and grow within any area
          of web or software development that drives real-world impact.
