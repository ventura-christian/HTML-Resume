      <h3>Description</h3>
      <section>
        I'm a college student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in
        Information Technology at Arizona State University, with a concentration
        in full-stack web development. I'm building a strong foundation in HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript while expanding into modern developer stacks that
        connect front-end, back-end, and AI-driven technologies. My goal is to
        gain hands-on experience through a tech internship-ideally one that
        involves working with websites, applications, or codebases in a
        meaningful, production-level environment. I'm eager to contribute,
        learn, and grow within any area of web or software development that
        drives real-world impact.
